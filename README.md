# org2seq

This is a bit of an ad-hoc tool and needs some other people to test it before it's generally useful.
With that being said, the main fix when moving from org-roam v2 to Logseq is mostly ironed out.
Links with org-roam file IDs are resolved to document titles compatible with Logseq!

```
lein run -- "/home/user/directory/with/org/files"
```
